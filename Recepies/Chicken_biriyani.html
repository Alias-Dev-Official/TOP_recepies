    <p><strong><em>Chicken Biryani is an iconic South Asian one-pot rice and meat dish, celebrated for its fragrant layers and blend of aromatic spices. Its origins are traced to Persian influences brought to India by the Mughals, combining Persian pilaf with Indian flavors. Over centuries, numerous local adaptations have emerged across the subcontinent, but all emphasize spiced chicken, basmati rice, saffron, and herbsâ€”often cooked together using the revered dum (steam) method.</em></strong></p>
